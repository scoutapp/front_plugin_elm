Front Plugin For Scout
======================

This is an internal tool that we are releasing as an example of writing a small application in Elm.

**NOTE: This tool does not work out-of-the-box, it is meant as an example only**

What does this do?
==================

[https://frontapp.com](Front) is a support tool which we've started using.
It has a mechanism to add your own custom plugins to the sidebar. This is a plugin.

This plugin fetches data from [https://scoutapp.com](ScoutAPM) about the accounts
related to the users who email us asking for support, so we can better answer
questions, and have quick links back to our Admin pages.

You need to be logged in as an admin of Scout to fully use this (ie, you have
to work with us!), but the code was interesting, and didn't have any secret
values in it, so we wanted to share.
